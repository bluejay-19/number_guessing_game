# Number Guessing Game

## Overview  
This is a simple interactive number guessing game written in Python. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game offers three difficulty levels that change how many guesses the player gets.

## Features  
- Random number generation between 1 and 100  
- Three difficulty levels:  
  - Easy (10 guesses)  
  - Medium (5 guesses)  
  - Hard (3 guesses)  
- Feedback on each guess (correct/incorrect)  
- Congratulatory message on winning  
- Option to play multiple rounds without restarting the program  
- Simple text-based user interface

## How to Play  
1. Run the Python script.  
2. Choose a difficulty level by entering 1 (Easy), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Hard).  
3. Try to guess the number within the allowed number of chances.  
4. After each guess, you will be told whether your guess is correct or incorrect.  
5. If you guess correctly, the game congratulates you and ends the round.  
6. If you run out of guesses, the game tells you the round is over.  
7. You can choose to play again or quit after each round.
